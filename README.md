# Recursive-combination
This assignment alllows you to practice passing 2-D arrays into a function
by doing matrix operations. You are required to do the following:
1. Using the format Add or Multiplication(float R[][N], float M1[][N], float
M2[][N]) to perform Add and Multiplication operations.
2. Put all these codes in one file and use switch statement and command
argument list, main(int argc and char *argv[]) to (1) select N (NN
matrix), (2) select function (Add or Multiplication) and (3) select if the
matrices M1 and M2 are randomly generated by random number generator
or input from keyborad.
3. The input and result should be output to a file

# Requirement:
(1) Read n from argv[1], k from argv[2].
(2) Read n numbers from keyboard which stored in array A[n].
(3) Ouput n, k, array A[n] and result to a file name “output”.
# Example:
> ./hw6 4 2
10 21 35 41
(Find all the combinations of 2 numbers out of 4 numbers from [10, 21, 35,
41] .)
# Command line:
> ./hw6 [n] [k]

# Output:
A file named “output” which include results.
(Note: Don’t print any unnecessary message to output file, thank you.)
for example:
> ./hw6 4 2
10 21 35 41
content in “output” will be
> cat output
4 2
10 21 35 41
10 21
10 35
10 41
21 35
21 41
35 41
